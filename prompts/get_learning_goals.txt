Based on the following activity, analyze which learning goals from our knowledge graph would be appropriate and generate additional goals if needed:

Activity Name: ${name}
Description: ${description}

Available Learning Goals from Knowledge Graph:
${graph_goals}

For each learning goal above, determine if it's relevant to this activity.
Then, if needed, suggest 1-2 additional learning goals that are not covered by the existing ones.

Each learning goal should:
- Be clear and measurable
- Be appropriate for 15-year-old students (8th grade)
- Have moderate granularity (not too specific to particular implementations)
- Focus on core conceptual understanding or skill application

Format the response as a JSON object with:
1. "selected_goals": array of ids of relevant goals from the graph
2. "additional_goals": array of new goals if needed

Example format:
{
    "selected_goals": [
        "data2_goal1", 
        "data2_goal2"
    ]
    "additional_goals": [
        "Master fundamental algorithmic concepts and their practical applications in data management",
        "Develop ability to analyze and compare algorithm efficiency using time and space complexity"
    ]
}
