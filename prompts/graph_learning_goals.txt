For the concept of ${concept}, generate 2-3 balanced learning goals for each of the following knowledge units. Each learning goal should:
- Be clear and measurable
- Be appropriate for 15-year-old students (8th grade)
- Have moderate granularity (not too specific to particular implementations)
- Focus on core conceptual understanding or skill application
- Include assessment criteria that define successful achievement

Knowledge units:
${nodes}

Format the response as a JSON object where each node ID maps to an array of learning goals. Each learning goal should have "name", "mastered" field, and "assessmentCriteria" (array of 2-4 specific observable behaviors).

Example format:
{
    "node1": [
        { 
            "name": "Apply loop structures to solve iterative problems", 
            "mastered": false,
            "assessment_criterias": [
                "Student correctly identifies when a loop is needed",
                "Student properly initializes and updates loop variables",
                "Student's loop solution produces the expected output",
                "Student can explain the purpose of each component in their loop"
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "Compare efficiency of different algorithmic approaches", 
            "mastered": false,
            "assessment_criterias": [
                "Student identifies at least two valid approaches to solve a problem",
                "Student accurately compares the efficiency of different solutions",
                "Student uses appropriate terminology to describe algorithmic efficiency"
            ]
        }
    ],
    "node2": [
        {
            "name": "Implement and explain conditional logic in algorithms", 
            "mastered": false,
            "assessment_criterias": [
                "Student correctly uses conditional statements in appropriate situations",
                "Student properly structures complex conditions using logical operators",
