Analyze the concept of ${concept} in computer science education and create a knowledge graph structure for 15-year-old students.

List fundamental knowledge units that make up this concept, where each unit:
- Represents a single, well-defined piece of knowledge
- Takes roughly similar time/effort to master as other units
- Is appropriate for a 15-year-old student's understanding level
- Belongs primarily to this concept (not to other core concepts)

Describe directional connections between these knowledge units that suggest a typical learning progression. While students may learn in different orders and often need to revisit topics, these connections should indicate common prerequisite relationships.

You don't need to follow any specific format - just describe the knowledge units and their directional relationships in natural language.

Keep the response focused and concise. Include only the most essential knowledge units that a 15-year-old should understand, rather than an exhaustive list.
