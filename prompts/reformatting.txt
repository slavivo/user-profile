Convert the following knowledge graph description into a properly formatted JSON structure.
The description is for the concept of ${concept} and contains information about nodes and their relationships.

Description to convert:
${initial_response}

Format the response as a JSON object with two arrays: 'nodes' and 'edges' following these rules:
1. Each node must have:
   - 'id': a unique string identifier (use concept1, concept2, etc.)
   - 'label': the actual concept name
   - 'progress': a number between 0-100 representing estimated mastery level
2. Each edge must have:
   - 'source': the id of the source node
   - 'target': the id of the target node
3. The JSON must be properly formatted with no trailing commas
4. All strings must be in double quotes
5. The response should contain ONLY the JSON object, no additional text

Example format:
{
    "nodes": [
        {"id": "concept1", "label": "Basic Concept"},
        {"id": "concept2", "label": "Advanced Concept"}
    ],
    "edges": [
        {"source": "concept1", "target": "concept2"}
    ]
}
