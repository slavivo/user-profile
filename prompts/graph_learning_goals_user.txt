For the concept node "${node_label}" in the section "${section_name}", generate comprehensive learning goals organized by grade level.

Current section's related nodes:
${other_nodes}

Other main sections and their key concepts:
${other_sections}

Each learning goal should:
- Be clear and measurable
- Have moderate granularity (not too specific to particular implementations)
- Focus on core conceptual understanding or skill application
- Be distinct from and not overlap with topics covered by:
  a) Other nodes in the current section (listed above)
  b) Related concepts in other main sections (listed above)
- Focus specifically on the unique aspects of "${node_label}" within the context of "${section_name}"

For example, if generating goals for a programming concept that involves data types:
- AVOID: "Explain different variable types" (this belongs in Data Types section)
- BETTER: "Apply appropriate variable types in program implementation"

Generate multiple learning goals for each grade level, ensuring proper progression and complexity:
- 5th grade: Foundational concepts and basic understanding
- 6th grade: Basic application and initial problem-solving
- 7th grade: Intermediate concepts and practical application
- 8th grade: Advanced application and problem-solving
- 9th grade: Complex concepts and real-world applications
- Extra: Additional challenging goals for advanced students

Format the response as a JSON object with grade levels and their respective learning goals:

{
    "5th_grade": [
        "Identify basic programming structures in simple code examples",
        "Write simple sequential programs using basic commands"
    ],
    "6th_grade": [
        "Create basic programs using variables and simple operations",
        "Debug simple programs by identifying common errors"
    ],
    "7th_grade": [
        "Implement programs using multiple control structures",
        "Develop programs that process user input effectively"
    ],
    "8th_grade": [
        "Design modular programs using functions and parameters",
        "Create programs that handle different types of errors gracefully"
    ],
    "9th_grade": [
        "Develop complex programs using multiple programming concepts",
        "Optimize code for better performance and readability"
    ],
    "extra": [
        "Implement advanced algorithms with multiple approaches",
        "Create programs that use advanced error handling and logging"
    ]
}
