For the concept of ${concept}, generate 2-3 specific learning goals for each of the following knowledge units. Each learning goal should:
- Be clear and measurable
- Be appropriate for a 15-year-old student
- Focus on a single, well-defined skill or understanding
- Include a mastery indicator (true/false)

Knowledge units:
${nodes}

Format the response as a JSON object where each node ID maps to an array of learning goals. Each learning goal should have a "name" and "mastered" field.

Example format:
{
    "node1": [
        { "name": "Understand and apply basic concept X", "mastered": false },
        { "name": "Demonstrate practical usage of concept Y", "mastered": true }
    ],
    "node2": [
        { "name": "Explain the relationship between X and Y", "mastered": false }
    ]
}
