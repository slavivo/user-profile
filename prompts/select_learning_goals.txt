Based on the following activity and the previously selected topics, analyze which learning goals would be most appropriate:

Activity Name: ${name}
Description: ${description}

Selected Topics and their Available Learning Goals:
${available_goals}

First, select the most relevant learning goals from the provided list that this activity directly supports.

Additional goals should ONLY be suggested in these specific cases:
1. If NO suitable learning goals were found in the provided list
2. If there is an absolutely essential learning goal for this activity that is not covered by any of the selected goals

Each learning goal should:
- Be clearly achievable through this activity
- Be appropriate for 15-year-old students (8th grade)
- Have measurable outcomes
- Focus on core conceptual understanding or skill application
- Have moderate granularity (not too specific to particular implementations)

Format the response as a JSON object with:
1. "selected_goals": array of learning goal ids from the available goals
2. "additional_goals": array of new learning goals ONLY if absolutely necessary (as per the criteria above)

Example format:
{
    "selected_goals": ["goal_id1", "goal_id2"],
    "additional_goals": []  // Empty if existing goals are sufficient
}

Alternative example (when no suitable goals found):
{
    "selected_goals": [],
    "additional_goals": [
        "Master fundamental algorithmic concepts and their practical applications in data management"
    ]
}
