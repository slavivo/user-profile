For each of the following learning goals, generate 2-4 specific assessment criteria that define successful achievement:

Learning Goals:
${goals}

Each assessment criterion should:
- Be specific and observable
- Focus on measurable behaviors or outcomes
- Be appropriate for 15-year-old students (8th grade)
- Cover different aspects of the learning goal (understanding, application, explanation)

Format the response as a JSON object where each learning goal maps to an array of assessment criteria.

Example format:
{   
    [
        ["Student correctly identifies appropriate algorithms for different problem types",
        "Student can explain the key concepts behind each algorithm",
        "Student successfully implements algorithms to solve practical problems",
        "Student can compare and contrast different algorithmic approaches"],
        ["Student accurately calculates time complexity for different algorithms",
        "Student can explain the trade-offs between different approaches",
        "Student uses appropriate terminology to describe algorithmic efficiency"]
    ]
}
